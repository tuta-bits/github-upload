    <p>Big Data is the latest buzzword. Everything that you see around 
      you thrives on data, and its facets. Every action that you take, 
      expenditure you make, and the income you receive, all get filed 
      into a massive database, accessible by the ones who wish to     
    analyse the same. <mark>These structured or unstructured data are 
    often mined, extracted, and utilised in different forms,</mark> in order
    to rationalise decisions and devise algorithms that would 
    enhance human life.</p>

 <figcaption>Are we secure online?</figcaption>
 </figure> 
 <p>In the wake of several cyber security attacks, including large scale
   DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Attacks, cybersecurity is a 
   major concern in the virtual world we live in today. These attacks
   target information that fall under various domains, and could even
   result in a severe identity theft and impersonation, while accessing
   highly sensitive records. That brings us to the question - How secure
   are we online? With identity essentials such as banking having 
   moved online, we are constantly in a flux of moving across cyber
   borders. This provides attackers motive and fodder to knock down your
   online presence. It is thus, highly important to adhere to certain 
   rules and regulations while staying online, in order to remain safe 
   and limit your exposure to the lowest possible extent.</p>
